# HTML / CSS / JavaScript Sandbox

This is my sandbox for testing some of the things I learn and work on. I just store them here and see how they work. Later on they can be added to my other projects/repos.

## Live Version

If you want to see a sort of a live demo, [here is a link](https://dimterion.github.io/Basic-html-css-js-app/) for the GitHub pages.

### This app is mostly built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Prettier
